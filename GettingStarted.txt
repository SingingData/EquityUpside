Overview of Requirements:
- Perplexity API Key- easy and pretty cheap
- Python 3.7+ (suggest installing this at or near your root level: https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install)
- An application VS Code with jupyter notebook plug-in to run the notebook (hit run all)
- Folder structure locally to get inputs (like equity list) and store outputs (like individual equity reports) Look at getting started .txt file for the right structure and files you need.
- Input Text file with stock tickers (one per line)  
- Create an environment file (.env file from text) with your API key and specific folder locations of inputs (like equity list) and outputs (for individual reports).  Look at the getting started .txt file for the right way to structure and create your .env file.  

Step 1:
Get a perplexity API key here https://www.perplexity.ai/help-center/en/articles/10352995-api-settings

Step 2:
If you don't already have python on your local machine, install it from this link at or near your root level.  (c:/users/yourname is a good spot.)
Here is the install link:  https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install

Step 3:  
Clone this repository locally:
In your search bar at bottom go to 'anaconda prompt'
Navigate to the location where you want this repo (ask LLM how to do this.  (..cd takes you up branch, cd branchname takes you down a branch))
Once you are at the location where you want your repo copy this command into the anaconda command prompt and hit enter:
git clone https://github.com/SingingData/EquityUpside

Step 4:
Install a developer tool.  I suggest VS code for it's native support of jupyter notebooks (the .ipynb files)
You'll run the notebook from this tool

Step 5:
Preparing your local environment and local .env file:

1. Create a .txt file (in notepad or other text editor).  This will become your .env environment file saved locally.
2. Paste the following items below into it.
3. Change the 'yournamehere' to your user name on your PC.  
4. If the folders listed here don't exist on your local drive, create them.
5. Copy the prompts from the 'reference prompts' folder on this repo to the folder locations identified below.  
6. Create your arbitrary equity_list.txt.  This should be a list of tickers, one ticker per line.
7. Retitle this file simply .env
8. Save your .env within your 'analysis_scripts' folder on your local drive.
